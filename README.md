# Docker and CI/CD-based web application with a friendly and intuitive user interface

This is a web-based Coffee Shop application. The idea for this application arose from the popularity of coffee in offices and day to day life. The benifits of these are:

#### For Customers:
* Convenient menu browsing
* Ingredient and nutritional info
* Loyalty points collection
* Skip the line with pre-orders

#### For the Coffee Shop:
* Fewer order mistakes
* Increased sales and upsells
* Efficient order processing
* Enhanced brand presence
* Direct customer communication

## üì¶ Technologies 

* React Js
* Tailwind CSS
* Redux
* Context API
* Figma
* Django
* JWT
* SQLite
* Docker
* GitHub Actions
* NGINX load balancer
* Selenium Testing

## ‚ú® Functionalities
Here is what you can do with the Coffee Shop Web Application:

### Sign Up:
* Users can register on the application using their email, name, and password. 
* To ensure accuracy, users are required to retype their password for verification.
* Once the user clicks on the sign-up button, the backend generates a hash of the password and stores it in the database.

### Login:
* Users can log in using their credentials, with backend verification using JWT authentication. 
* Upon successful verification, an authentication token is assigned to the user and stored in the browser's local storage for 90 days. 
* Token renewal occurs automatically after 90 days if the user remains logged in.

### Products:
* Users can select different products and add them to their cart.

### Profile:
* Users can access their profile by clicking on their name in the navigation bar, allowing them to view their information.

### Cart:
* Within the cart, users can adjust the quantity of selected items or remove them entirely.
* The cart dynamically updates to display the total price and quantity of items added.

### DevOps:
* For version control, GitHub is utilized and a CI/CD pipeline is created using GitHub Actions. 
* Whenever code is pushed to GitHub, the pipeline triggers. Initially, Selenium tests ensure that the Login page loads correctly. 
* Subsequently, a new image is generated and deployed to the local server. 
* Two servers are deployed, managed by an NGINX load balancer for optimal load distribution. 
* Watchtower continually monitors for new Docker images and automatically updates running containers with the latest versions.

## üí≠ How can it be improved? 

* Add additional authorization features.
* Add payment functionality.
